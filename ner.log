Calcium mobilization in enzymically isolated single intact and skinned muscle cells of the porcine coronary artery.
The mobilization of 45Ca2+ was investigated in collagenase-treated single smooth muscle cells of the porcine coronary artery. After removal of extracellular 45Ca2+ by 10 mM-EGTA at 0 degree C, the content of exchangeable Ca2+ was estimated to be 0.42 +/- 0.02 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells at rest and 0.62 +/- 0.03 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells in 102.5 mM-external K solution. The efflux of 45Ca2+ into Ca2+-free solution, estimated from the 45Ca2+ remaining in the cells, increased temperature dependently and was reduced by oligomycin. The muscle cells at rest had a substantial amount of stored Ca2+ which was releasable by caffeine or acetylcholine. Saponin-treated (skinned) muscle cells accumulated 45Ca2+ in the presence of Mg ATP. Two mechanisms of ATP-dependent Ca2+ sequestration were observed: one exhibited a low affinity for Ca2+ but a high-capacity uptake which was sensitive to sodium azide; this was thought to be located in the mitochondria. The other had a high-affinity (1.5/microM) and low-capacity uptake (0.92 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells), which was insensitive to sodium azide, potentiated by oxalate and was thought to be mainly mediated via the sarcoplasmic reticulum (s.r.). The minimum concentration of free Ca2+ required for the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake in the saponin-treated cells was about 20 nM by the s.r. and 1 microM by the mitochondria. Thus, the mitochondria seem to play a minor role in regulating cytoplasmic Ca2+ during the contraction-relaxation cycle. These results indicate that enzymically isolated muscle cells are functionally intact, and may facilitate direct measurement of Ca2+ movements when attempting to estimate the physiological role of Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscles.

Histochemical demonstration of copper in normal rat brain and spinal cord. Evidence of localization in glial cells.
The high sensitivity of the magnesium-dithizonate silver-dithizonate (MDSD) staining procedure makes this method very suitable for the histochemical localization of copper in different regions of the central nervous system of adult rats. In the telencephalon (bulbus olfactorius, nucleus caudatus-putamen, septum pellucidum and area dentata), diencephalon (nucleus habenulae medialis, nuclei of the hypothalamus in the vicinity of the third ventricle, and corpus mamillare), mesencephalon (substantia nigra), cerebellum (mainly in the nodulus), pons (locus coeruleus, nucleus vestibularis), medulla oblongata (nucleus tractus solitarii) and spinal cord, the glial cells exhibit specific copper staining. The glial cells of some circumventricular organs (e.g. the subfornical organ) are also stained using the MDSD method. The significant staining observed in white-matter glial cells (e.g. in the corpus callosum, cerebellum and spinal cord) further indicates the very high sensitivity of this method. In glial cells of the same regions, the presence of copper can likewise be demonstrated using the modified sulphide silver method. On the basis of the present histochemical results, it is suggested that copper may play an important role in the normal physiological functioning of glial cells and also, via glial-neuron interactions, in neuronal processes.

Calcium mobilization in enzymically isolated single intact and skinned muscle cells of the porcine coronary artery.
The mobilization of 45Ca2+ was investigated in collagenase-treated single smooth muscle cells of the porcine coronary artery. After removal of extracellular 45Ca2+ by 10 mM-EGTA at 0 degree C, the content of exchangeable Ca2+ was estimated to be 0.42 +/- 0.02 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells at rest and 0.62 +/- 0.03 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells in 102.5 mM-external K solution. The efflux of 45Ca2+ into Ca2+-free solution, estimated from the 45Ca2+ remaining in the cells, increased temperature dependently and was reduced by oligomycin. The muscle cells at rest had a substantial amount of stored Ca2+ which was releasable by caffeine or acetylcholine. Saponin-treated (skinned) muscle cells accumulated 45Ca2+ in the presence of Mg ATP. Two mechanisms of ATP-dependent Ca2+ sequestration were observed: one exhibited a low affinity for Ca2+ but a high-capacity uptake which was sensitive to sodium azide; this was thought to be located in the mitochondria. The other had a high-affinity (1.5/microM) and low-capacity uptake (0.92 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells), which was insensitive to sodium azide, potentiated by oxalate and was thought to be mainly mediated via the sarcoplasmic reticulum (s.r.). The minimum concentration of free Ca2+ required for the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake in the saponin-treated cells was about 20 nM by the s.r. and 1 microM by the mitochondria. Thus, the mitochondria seem to play a minor role in regulating cytoplasmic Ca2+ during the contraction-relaxation cycle. These results indicate that enzymically isolated muscle cells are functionally intact, and may facilitate direct measurement of Ca2+ movements when attempting to estimate the physiological role of Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscles.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guided early cardioversion (CV) in conjunction with short-term anticoagulation has been shown to be safe, and an alternative to prolonged conventional anticoagulation therapy. Recently, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) have been used successfully as an alternative to standard heparin therapy obviating the need for hospitalization and APTT monitoring. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of TEE guided early cardioversion in conjunction with short-term LMWH use in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The study group consisted of 172 consecutive patients with NVAF. Before TEE, 90 patients received LMWH (Dalteparin 2 x 5,000U) and 82 patients received standard heparin (UFH) (5,000U bolus followed by infusion to raise APTT to 1.5 times control). TEE was performed and the left atrium and left atrial appendage were examined thoroughly for the presence of thrombus. One patient from each group was excluded due to detection of a left atrial thrombus by TEE. Immediately after TEE, CV was attempted and warfarin was initiated. All patients received warfarin for one month after CV. In the LMWH group, 89 of 90 patients (98.9%) were successfully cardioverted. CV was successful in 97.5% of the patients in the UFH group. None of the patients experienced thromboembolic events during the four weeks after CV. TEE guided early CV in conjunction with short-term LMWH treatment is as safe as UFH for the prevention of thromboembolic events after CV.

Evaluation of the VA/KP problem list subset of SNOMED as a clinical terminology for electronic prescription clinical decision support.
A standardized terminology for medical indications is essential for building e-prescription applications with decision support. The FDA has adopted the Veteran Administration and Kaiser Permanente (VA/KP) Problem List Subset of SNOMED as the terminology to represent indications in electronic labels. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of this subset to represent the text phrases extracted from a medication decision support system and the indications section of existing drug labels. We compiled a test set of 1265 distinct indication phrases and mapped them to (1) UMLS, (2) Entire SNOMED, (3) All Precoordinated concepts from the "Clinical Finding" hierarchy of SNOMED, and (4) VA/KP Subset. 95% of the phrases mapped to concepts in UMLS, 90.3% to SNOMED, 79.5% to SNOMED Precordinated and 71.1% mapped completely or partially to concepts in the VA/KP subset. Our study suggests that the VA/KP Subset has significant limitations for coding drug indications; however, when focusing on indications as medical conditions only, the coverage seems more adequate.

Comparison of lung volume measurements by antero-posterior chest X-ray and the SF6 washout technique in mechanically ventilated infants.
While anterior/posterior chest x-rays (CXR) are routinely performed to estimate lung volume (LV) and adjust ventilator settings, the precise measurement of LV requires additional sophistication. In 31 infants ventilated because of surfactant deficiency (n=23), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n=7), or pulmonary hypoplasia (n=1) with either intermittent positive pressure (n=18) or high frequency oscillation (n=13) (gestational age 23-39 weeks (median 26 weeks); birthweight 550-2780 g (median 840 g); age at measurement 1-91 days (median 6 days); weight at study time (WST) 675-3000 g (median 938 g)), we investigated whether LV, as measured by the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) washout technique, could by estimated from CXR by: 1) the sum (A+B) of the right (A) and left (B) lung fields areas; 2) the product (LxW) of the distances from the right apex to the right costophrenic angle (L) and between both costophrenic angles (W); 3) the diaphragm position relative to the posterior parts of the ribs (DP); and 4) the lung radiolucency (RL, grades 0-4). Correlations between A+B (r=0.44) or LxW (r=0.37) and LV were poor, but improved when A+B, LxW, and LV were normalized to WST: (A+B)/WST vs. LV/WST (r=0.74), and LxW/WST vs. LV/WST (r=0.67). DP (r=0.13) and RL (Spearman's rho=0.17) did not correlate with LV/WST. A multiple linear regression analysis led to the following best-fit equation: LV/WST=2.58 (A+B)/WST - 5.47 DP + 42.2 (r=0.83). We concluded that an estimate of LV from CXR lacked sufficient accuracy. DP and RL did not correlate with LV measured by SF6 washout.

The issue of equality in the between-and within-level structures in Multilevel Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MCFA) models has been influential for obtaining unbiased parameter estimates and statistical inferences. A commonly seen condition is the inequality of factor loadings under equal level-varying structures. With mathematical investigation and Monte Carlo simulation, this study compared the robustness of five statistical models including two model-based (a true and a mis-specified models), one design-based, and two maximum models (two models where the full rank of variance-covariance matrix is estimated in between level and within level, respectively) in analyzing complex survey measurement data with level-varying factor loadings. The empirical data of 120 3rd graders' (from 40 classrooms) perceived Harter competence scale were modeled using MCFA and the parameter estimates were used as true parameters to perform the Monte Carlo simulation study. Results showed maximum models was robust to unequal factor loadings while the design-based and the miss-specified model-based approaches produced conflated results and spurious statistical inferences. We recommend the use of maximum models if researchers have limited information about the pattern of factor loadings and measurement structures. Measurement models are key components of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM); therefore, the findings can be generalized to multilevel SEM and CFA models. Mplus codes are provided for maximum models and other analytical models.

Partial recovery of abnormal insula and dorsolateral prefrontal connectivity to cognitive networks in chronic low back pain after treatment.
We previously reported that effective treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) reversed abnormal brain structure and functional MRI (fMRI) activity during cognitive task performance, particularly in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Here, we used resting-state fMRI to examine how chronic pain affects connectivity of brain networks supporting cognitive functioning and the effect of treatment in 14 CLBP patients and 16 healthy, pain-free controls (scans were acquired at baseline for all subjects and at 6-months post-treatment for patients and a matched time-point for 10 controls). The main networks activated during cognitive task performance, task-positive network (TPN) and task-negative network (TNN) (aka default mode) network, were identified in subjects' task fMRI data and used to define matching networks in resting-state data. The connectivity of these cognitive resting-state networks was compared between groups, and before and after treatment. Our findings converged on the bilateral insula (INS) as the region of aberrant cognitive resting-state connectivity in patients pretreatment versus controls. These findings were complemented by an independent, data-driven approach showing altered global connectivity of the INS. Detailed investigation of the INS confirmed reduced connectivity to widespread TPN and TNN areas, which was partially restored post-treatment. Furthermore, analysis of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) data revealed structural changes in white matter supporting these findings. The left DLPFC also showed aberrant connectivity that was restored post-treatment. Altogether, our findings implicate the bilateral INS and left DLPFC as key nodes of disrupted cognition-related intrinsic connectivity in CLBP, and the resulting imbalance between TPN and TNN function is partially restored with treatment.

Perceived entitlement causes discrimination against attractive job candidates in the domain of relatively less desirable jobs.
People generally hold positive stereotypes of physically attractive people and because of those stereotypes often treat them more favorably. However, we propose that some beliefs about attractive people, specifically, the perception that attractive individuals have a greater sense of entitlement than less attractive individuals, can result in negative treatment of attractive people. We examine this in the context of job selection and propose that for relatively less desirable jobs, attractive candidates will be discriminated against. We argue that the ascribed sense of entitlement to good outcomes leads to perceptions that attractive individuals are more likely to be dissatisfied working in relatively less desirable jobs. When selecting candidates for relatively less desirable jobs, decision makers try to ascertain whether a candidate would be satisfied in those jobs, and the stereotype of attractive individuals feeling entitled to good outcomes makes decision makers judge attractive candidates as more likely to be dissatisfied in relatively less (but not more) desirable jobs. Consequently, attractive candidates are discriminated against in the selection for relatively less desirable jobs. Four experiments found support for this theory. Our results suggest that different discriminatory processes operate when decision makers select among candidates for relatively less desirable jobs and that attractive people might be systematically discriminated against in a segment of the workforce.

T lymphocytes up-regulate the synthesis of ligands for E- and P-selectin during proliferative responses in vivo and in vitro. Previous studies from our laboratories indicated that the alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase FucT-VII regulates the synthesis of E-selectin ligands and sialylated Lewis(x)-related epitopes (sLe(x)-related epitopes) in human T lymphoblasts. The current report shows that production of both P- and E-selectin ligands is FucT-VII dependent, but peak synthesis of each occurs at different levels of fucosyltransferase activity in intact cells. In brief, FucT-VII mRNA levels were higher in cultured T lymphoblasts expressing sLe(x)-related epitopes and both selectin ligands than in cells expressing P-selectin ligands alone. However, synthesis of the epitopes and both selectin ligands required the FucT-VII enzyme in transfected Molt-4 cells. In contrast, neither constitutive nor transfection-enhanced levels of the FucT-IV enzyme generated active P-selectin ligands in these lines. In addition, targeted deletion of the FucT-VII gene in mice markedly inhibited the synthesis of both P- and E-selectin ligands during blast transformation in vitro. Finally, the optimal synthesis of active P-selectin ligands occurred at lower level of FucT-VII activity than required for synthesis of equally active E-selectin ligands in both cultured T lymphoblasts and FucT-VII transfectants. Consequently, the FucT-VII enzyme is essential for the synthesis of both P- and E-selectin ligands by T lymphoblasts, and its activity determines whether P-selectin ligands are expressed alone or in conjunction with E-selectin ligands and sLe(x)-related epitopes on human T cells.

This article examines the historical development of employment-at-will, discusses the pros and cons of at-will employment, describes the exceptions to the doctrine, and discusses at-will employment issues in the health care industry.

Heterogeneity of Antiviral Responses in the Upper Respiratory Tract Mediates Differential Non-lytic Clearance of Influenza Viruses.
Influenza viruses initiate infection in the upper respiratory tract (URT), but early viral tropism and the importance of cell-type-specific antiviral responses in this tissue remain incompletely understood. By infecting transgenic lox-stop-lox reporter mice with a Cre-recombinase-expressing influenza B virus, we identify olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) as a major viral cell target in the URT. These cells become infected, then eliminate the virus and survive in the host post-resolution of infection. OSN responses to infection are characterized by a strong induction of interferon-stimulated genes and more rapid clearance of viral protein relative to other cells in the epithelium. We speculate that this cell-type-specific response likely serves to protect the central nervous system from infection. More broadly, these results highlight the importance of evaluating antiviral responses across different cell types, even those within the same tissue, to more fully understand the mechanisms of viral disease.

This study provides convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity data for the Five-Factor Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (FFOCI), a newly developed measure of traits relevant to obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) from the perspective of the Five-factor model (FFM). Twelve scales were constructed as maladaptive variants of specific FFM facets (e.g., Perfectionism as a maladaptive variant of FFM competence). On the basis of data from 407 undergraduates (oversampled for OCPD symptoms) these 12 scales demonstrated convergent correlations with established measures of OCPD and the FFM. Further, they obtained strong discriminant validity with respect to facets from other FFM domains. Most important, the individual scales and total score of the FFOCI obtained incremental validity beyond existing measures of the FFM and OCPD for predicting a composite measure of obsessive-compulsive symptomatology. The findings support the validity of the FFOCI as a measure of obsessive-compulsive personality traits, as well as of maladaptive variants of the FFM.

Chasing red herrings: Memory of distractors causes fixation in creative problem solving.
Two experiments tested the red herring retrieval hypothesis, which states that fixation in creative problem solving is worse when memory for red herrings (i.e., inappropriate or incorrect solutions) is strengthened. In Experiment 1, when associations between Remote Associates Test (RAT) problem words (e.g., COTTAGE, SWISS, CAKE) and related red herring words (e.g., hut, chocolate, icing) were strengthened via repetition, an encoding variable, fixation was found to increase. In Experiment 2, when associations were formed between RAT problem contexts and red herrings, then subsequent reinstatement of problem contexts during RAT problem solving trials (as compared with showing new contexts) also worsened fixation effects. Our results add to the increasing body of research that connects memory with creative problem solving, and they suggest possible ways for overcoming fixation effects.

S100A4 expression with reduced E-cadherin expression predicts distant metastasis of human malignant melanoma cell lines in the NOD/SCID/gammaCnull (NOG) mouse model.
Tumor xenografts in immune-deficient mice (athymic nude mice and SCID mice) are well-established animal models for the study of human cancer. Several human melanoma cell lines were reported to metastasize in the immune-deficient mice models. However, metastatic rates were extremely low in spite of large numbers of injections of cancer cells, more than 1 x 10(6) cells/mouse. The NOD/SCID/gamma(C)(null) (NOG) mouse shows multiple immunological dysfunctions, including cytokine production capability, in addition to the functional incompetence of T, B and natural killer (NK) cells. However, the immune-deficient mice, with preserved NK cell activity, might interfere with engraftment efficiency. We examined the distant metastasis of the human melanoma cell lines (A2058, A375, G361 and HMY-1, 1 x 10(4) cells/mouse) in the 6 weeks after intravenous inoculation. All four melanoma cell lines showed metastasis in the NOG mice, while no metastatic lesions were observed in the NOD/SCID mice. Metastatic lesions were noted in the liver and lung of 6/6 (100%) mice at A2058, 8/9 (89%) at A375, 2/6 (33%) at G361 and 2/8 (25%) at HMY-1. A2058 and A375 cell lines with high metastatic potentials show increased gene expression of S100A4. Western blot assay confirmed the increased protein levels of S100A4 in the A2058 and A375 cell lines. E-cadherin gene expression was conversely inhibited in these cell lines. The increased expression of S100A4 combined with inhibited E-cadherin expression resulted in high metastatic potentials of the human melanoma cell lines in vivo.

Solitary plasmacytoma of the frontal bone.
We report a case of a solitary, painless, lytic lesion in the frontal bone in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. This was investigated with plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), angiography and finally biopsy. Histology showed it to be a plasmacytoma. The radiological features of this lesion are discussed. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone has an uncertain relationship to multiple myeloma; it has only rarely been described in the skull and very rarely in the frontal bone.

Conceptual knowledge increases infants' memory capacity.
Adults can expand their limited working memory capacity by using stored conceptual knowledge to chunk items into interrelated units. For example, adults are better at remembering the letter string PBSBBCCNN after parsing it into three smaller units: the television acronyms PBS, BBC, and CNN. Is this chunking a learned strategy acquired through instruction? We explored the origins of this ability by asking whether untrained infants can use conceptual knowledge to increase memory. In the absence of any grouping cues, 14-month-old infants can track only three hidden objects at once, demonstrating the standard limit of working memory. In four experiments we show that infants can surpass this limit when given perceptual, conceptual, linguistic, or spatial cues to parse larger arrays into smaller units that are more efficiently stored in memory. This work offers evidence of memory expansion based on conceptual knowledge in untrained, preverbal subjects. Our findings demonstrate that without instruction, and in the absence of robust language, a fundamental memory computation is available throughout the lifespan, years before the development of explicit metamemorial strategies.

Bmp2 transcription in osteoblast progenitors is regulated by a distant 3' enhancer located 156.3 kilobases from the promoter.
Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (encoded by Bmp2) has been implicated as an important signaling ligand for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation and as a genetic risk factor for osteoporosis. To initially survey a large genomic region flanking the mouse Bmp2 gene for cis-regulatory function, two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones that extend far upstream and downstream of the gene were engineered to contain a lacZ reporter cassette and tested in transgenic mice. Each BAC clone directs a distinct subset of normal Bmp2 expression patterns, suggesting a modular arrangement of distant Bmp2 regulatory elements. Strikingly, regulatory sequences required for Bmp2 expression in differentiating osteoblasts, as well as tooth buds, hair placodes, kidney, and other tissues, are located more than 53 kilobases 3' to the promoter. By testing BACs with engineered deletions across this distant 3' region, we parsed these regulatory elements into separate locations and more closely refined the location of the osteoblast progenitor element. Finally, a conserved osteoblast progenitor enhancer was identified within a 656-bp sequence located 156.3 kilobases 3' from the promoter. The identification of this enhancer should permit further investigation of upstream regulatory mechanisms that control Bmp2 transcription during osteoblast differentiation and are relevant to further studies of Bmp2 as a candidate risk factor gene for osteoporosis.

Adverse pregnancy outcome in patients with low pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A: The Indian Experience.

Calcium mobilization in enzymically isolated single intact and skinned muscle cells of the porcine coronary artery.
The mobilization of 45Ca2+ was investigated in collagenase-treated single smooth muscle cells of the porcine coronary artery. After removal of extracellular 45Ca2+ by 10 mM-EGTA at 0 degree C, the content of exchangeable Ca2+ was estimated to be 0.42 +/- 0.02 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells at rest and 0.62 +/- 0.03 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells in 102.5 mM-external K solution. The efflux of 45Ca2+ into Ca2+-free solution, estimated from the 45Ca2+ remaining in the cells, increased temperature dependently and was reduced by oligomycin. The muscle cells at rest had a substantial amount of stored Ca2+ which was releasable by caffeine or acetylcholine. Saponin-treated (skinned) muscle cells accumulated 45Ca2+ in the presence of Mg ATP. Two mechanisms of ATP-dependent Ca2+ sequestration were observed: one exhibited a low affinity for Ca2+ but a high-capacity uptake which was sensitive to sodium azide; this was thought to be located in the mitochondria. The other had a high-affinity (1.5/microM) and low-capacity uptake (0.92 nmol/2 X 10(5) cells), which was insensitive to sodium azide, potentiated by oxalate and was thought to be mainly mediated via the sarcoplasmic reticulum (s.r.). The minimum concentration of free Ca2+ required for the ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake in the saponin-treated cells was about 20 nM by the s.r. and 1 microM by the mitochondria. Thus, the mitochondria seem to play a minor role in regulating cytoplasmic Ca2+ during the contraction-relaxation cycle. These results indicate that enzymically isolated muscle cells are functionally intact, and may facilitate direct measurement of Ca2+ movements when attempting to estimate the physiological role of Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscles.

Histochemical demonstration of copper in normal rat brain and spinal cord. Evidence of localization in glial cells.
The high sensitivity of the magnesium-dithizonate silver-dithizonate (MDSD) staining procedure makes this method very suitable for the histochemical localization of copper in different regions of the central nervous system of adult rats. In the telencephalon (bulbus olfactorius, nucleus caudatus-putamen, septum pellucidum and area dentata), diencephalon (nucleus habenulae medialis, nuclei of the hypothalamus in the vicinity of the third ventricle, and corpus mamillare), mesencephalon (substantia nigra), cerebellum (mainly in the nodulus), pons (locus coeruleus, nucleus vestibularis), medulla oblongata (nucleus tractus solitarii) and spinal cord, the glial cells exhibit specific copper staining. The glial cells of some circumventricular organs (e.g. the subfornical organ) are also stained using the MDSD method. The significant staining observed in white-matter glial cells (e.g. in the corpus callosum, cerebellum and spinal cord) further indicates the very high sensitivity of this method. In glial cells of the same regions, the presence of copper can likewise be demonstrated using the modified sulphide silver method. On the basis of the present histochemical results, it is suggested that copper may play an important role in the normal physiological functioning of glial cells and also, via glial-neuron interactions, in neuronal processes.
